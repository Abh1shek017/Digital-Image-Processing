# Basic Image Operations – Digital Image Processing

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates basic image processing operations using MATLAB as part of the Digital Image Processing (DIP) laboratory. The objective is to understand how digital images are represented and how simple operations can be performed on them.

## Operations Performed

### 1. Random Matrix Generation
- An 8×8 matrix with random integer values in the range 0–255 is generated.
- This matrix simulates a small grayscale image, where each value represents a pixel intensity.

### 2. Image Acquisition
- A color image is read from the system using MATLAB’s image reading function.
- The original RGB image is displayed for reference.

### 3. RGB to Grayscale Conversion
- The input RGB image is converted into a grayscale image to represent intensity information using a single channel.

### 4. Color Channel Extraction
- The red channel of the RGB image is extracted by removing the green and blue channels.
- This operation helps in understanding color plane slicing.

### 5. Binary Image Generation
- The grayscale image is converted into a binary image using a fixed threshold value.
- Pixels above the threshold are assigned white, and others are assigned black.

### 6. Histogram Equalization
- Histogram equalization is applied to the grayscale image to enhance contrast and improve visibility of image details.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Digital Image Processing functions

## Purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to gain practical understanding of:
- Image representation as matrices
- Grayscale conversion
- Color channel manipulation
- Thresholding
- Image enhancement techniques
